`scp install.sh vmblogtest:install.sh`

Now log into the server

`ssh vmblogtest`

```
chmod 700 install.sh
sudo ./install.sh

## AWS Instructions

To begin with, set up an Amazon Web Services Account, and got to the control panel

If unsure about the type of instance you want, start with a new EC2 with Ubuntu 12.x LTS operating system and port 80 open in the security group. Also make sure to set up your .ssh/config and keys (Amazon provide some help with this).

If this is a complete stumbling block, please wait until this prouct is prepared for general public use.
